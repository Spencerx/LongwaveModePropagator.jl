# INTEG steps and functions

## MF_INTEG
"""
Perform an integration of the differential equations for the ionospheric reflection matrix using RK integration formulas. The integration variables are the elements of the matrix (R+1)/C where R is the reflection matrix described by Budden. The (R+1)/C variables used in the comparison step are denoted as `X`.
